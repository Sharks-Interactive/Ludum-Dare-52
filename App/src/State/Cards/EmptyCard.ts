        (limited) playtesting, so you've seemingly backed yourself into a corner. You have two choices here.
        You can clear your history and you'll get lots of the same cards again, or you can start again and try to get
        a different ending. Do note you are not seeing this because you've seen all the cards, if you did you would've won.
        There are more you haven't seen. You just don't have the right conditions for them right now.
